# Thyroid Machine Learning

A project made for my Machine Learning class, the goal of this project was to create 3 models (2 classiers and 1 regressor) to predict certain atributes of individuals having a provided dataset for training the model. The classifiers were used to predict if an individual as some thyorid desease and to predict his sex, the regressor was used to predict the age. Me and my group completed successfully this project obtaining the top grade.

This project uses python inside the jupyter notebook and some machine learning and useful libraries such as scikit-learn, imblearn, xgboost, pandas, etc...
